# smoking_cessation
In this project I analyze data from a randomized clinical trial on the effectiveness of two treatments for smoking cessation.

I perform a survival analysis with the goal of extending the time until relapse for smoking cigarettes. I visualize the data and use the Cox proportional hazards model to determine which treatment is most effective. I conclude with my recommendation for the most effective treatment. Understanding the factors that contribute to the best smoking cessation outcomes is of great importance to public health.
